# 🔢 Counter App with Flutter 🔢  

Welcome to the **Counter App**, a simple and interactive Flutter app where you can increase a counter with each button click. Perfect for learning state management with `StatefulWidget`. 🎉  

---  

## ✨ Features  

- **📊 Counter Functionality**:  
  - Press the button to increase the counter.  
  - The updated counter value is displayed dynamically.  

- **🎨 Simple UI**:  
  - Minimalistic design with a central button and counter display.  
  - Styled with Material Design elements.  

- **📂 Modular Code**:  
  - Uses a separate stateful widget (`MyBody`) for managing the counter logic.  

---  

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **AppBar**:  
   - Displays the title: **"Saja Nazih Asfour"** in the center.  

2. **Counter Display**:  
   - Shows the current value of the counter.  

3. **Elevated Button**:  
   - Clicking the button increments the counter and updates the display.  

4. **State Management**:  
   - Utilizes `setState` to re-render the UI with the updated counter value.
